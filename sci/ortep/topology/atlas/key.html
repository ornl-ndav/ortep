Cubic Orbifold Atlas - Notes on Figures and Main Table
</h2></center>
<p>
Underlying Topological Space
<p>
Before interpreting the orbifold drawings, one should first note the 
underlying topological space listed at the top of each atlas page.
The 3-sphere S<sup>3</sup> may be considered regular 3-space plus a
point at infinity.  Thus in #196 we have a tetrahedral singular set
with one W<sub>2</sub> invariant limiting lattice complex at the
center of the tetrahedron and a second W<sub>2</sub> on the point at
infinity.  Thus there are two geodesic paths joining the two
J<sub>2</sub> invariant lattice complexes as indicated by the dotted
line in the left-hand drawings for #196.  

<p>
A 3-disk D<sup>3</sup>, has a mirror boundary made up of one to three
Wyckoff mirror regions delineated by thicker lines.  There are two
Wyckoff mirror regions in #221, each of which has two subregions to
forming the four faces of the tetrahedron.  Note that mirror regions
are usually depicted as spherical (e.g., #223) rather than flat as in
#221.

<p>
Projective planes RP<sup>2</sup> and RP<sup>3</sup> cannot be drawn
directly in regular 3-space.  The dashed line around a cone base
signifies the 2-dimensional antipodal convention (e.g., #201), and the
opposing arrows on a sphere signify the 3-dimensional antipodal
convention (e.g., #197).  Antipodal means that upon exiting the figure
surface at a given angle of incidence, you go half way around the
(cone) axis or (sphere) center, then reenter the surface at the same
angle of incidence.

<p>
Characteristic (resp. Non-Characteristic) Orbits = Lattice 
(resp. Limiting Lattice) Complexes

<p>
A set of points generated from a point Xo by the space group G is
called a crystallographic orbit Og(Xo).  Let E be the symmetry
(eigensymmetry) of this set of points.  If E=G, Og(Xo) is a
characteristic crystallographic orbit.  However if E is a supergroup
of G, Og(Xo) is a non-characteristic crystallographic orbit with
respect to G. The table lists the standard (characteristic) Wyckoff
sets (top rows without cover column entries), followed by the
non-characteristic ones.  The characteristic and non-characteristic
sites characterize symmetry and pseudo-symmetry respectively.
Characteristic and non-characteristic orbits are also called lattice
complexes and limiting lattice complexes, respectively.

<p>
Each invariant (fixed point) lattice complex is a single point within
the orbifold labeled with an invariant lattice complex symbol in the
left-hand drawing.  However, the present drawings sometimes do not 
show all the invariant lattice complex points listed in the table. 
This is partially to prevent clutter but more often it means we 
we are not sure where some of them should be positioned at present.

<p>
The orbifold tables are based on the International Tables for
Crystallography, Vol.  a; the book by P. Engel, T. Matsumoto, G.
Steinmann and H. Wondratshek, "The Non-Characteristic Orbits of the
Space Groups", <i>Zeit.  fur Krist.</i> (1984), Supplement Issue No.
1; and the lattice complexes references given in our chapter on that
subject.

<p>
<a name="col1">Col. 1 - Figure Pseudo-Symmetry (FPS)</a>
<p>
The left singular set figure of the 3-orbifold drawing may display a
pseudo-symmetry among equal, but distinct, Wyckoff sites.  Wyckoff
sites are labeled by small letters in the right-hand drawing.  The
pseudo symmetry is related to the group normalizer discussed under
Wyckoff Sets below, but we do not have an analytical correlation at
present.  Empirically, it appears as a local geometric point symmetry
(222, 2mm, 2/m, 2 or m) within the left drawing and is listed in the
top line of each page to aid visual recognition of the FPS.  The
corresponding parent supergroups containing a true symmetry
subcomponent (i.e., m or 2) of the FPS are listed in the FPS and
2[4]-Cover columns.

<p>
<a name="col2">Col. 2 - Multiplicity (Mult)</a>
<p>
Each row in the table represents a Wyckoff set which may contain two
or more equivalent but distinct Wyckoff sites.  The first number in
the Mult column gives the multiplicity of the Wyckoff site and the
second the number of Wyckoff sites in the Wyckoff set.  

<p> 
<a name="col3">Col.  3 - Lattice Complex (Lattice Comp)</a> <p> The
invariant lattice complex sites in the cubic space groups, listed in
increasing Wyckoff-site unit-cell multiplicity [n], are:  [1] P; [2]
I; [3] J; [4] F, +Y, -Y; [6] J*, W; [8] D, +Y*, -Y*; [12] S, +V, -V,
W*; [16] T, Y**; and [24] S*, V*.  A subscript 2 on a symbol denotes a
2 x 2 x 2 block of unit cells, which increases the above multiplicity 
by a factor of 8.

<p>
A pair of invariant lattice complex points (X and Y) of multiplicity m
and n, respectively, joined by an axis of multiplicity p has the
univariant lattice complex symbol (p/m)X[-](p/n)Y.  For example, the
invariant lattice complex F's and W's of #208 (Wyckoff site
multiplicity 4 and 6, respectively) are joined by 2-fold axes (l1, l2,
k1, k2) of multiplicity 12, producing the symbol F3[-]W2.  The numbers
2 and 3 in this univariant lattice complex symbol denote coordination
multiplicity around the invariant lattice complex sites F and W,
respectively.

<p>
One or more limiting lattice complex points may be on a geodesic line
between two invariant lattice complex (or limiting lattice complex)
points.  Limiting lattice complexes always have the multiplicity of
the site on which they lie.  For example, there is an univariant
lattice complex P4[F]P4 in #195 with F on a 3-axis of multiplicity 4;
thus F has multiplicity 4. If only one limiting lattice complex and no
other punctuation symbols is listed in brackets between two invariant
lattice complexes, it is positioned midway way between them along the
geodesic line.

<p>
There is also a F3[-]W2 univariant limiting lattice complex in #195
with F and W on axes of multiplicity 4 and 6, respectively, joined by
an "axis" of site symmetry 1 with multiplicity 12, which makes it
homeomorphic to the univariant (non-limiting) lattice complex example
from #208 discussed above.  This relation is recorded in Col. 6 of
#195.  Also note from the left orbifold figure of #195 that the two
F3[-]W2 univariant limiting sites are on a common geodesic (straight
line in this case) and form a 2-fold axis of normalizer pseudo-symmetry
(i.e., the Figure Pseudo-Symmetry in Col. 1).

<p>
<a name="col4">Col. 4 - Graph of Groups (Group Graph)</a>
<p>
The singular set of the orbifold forms a graph, and all components of
the graph (i.e., nodes and links) are spherical orbifolds.  A link
between nodes is a subgroup of both nodes.  Cubic orbifold #201 has
332, 30 and 222 nodes joined by 2- and 3-fold links and a 2-fold loop
(via the antipodal relationship).  The group graph symbols for the
univariant lattice complexes are 33<2>22, 32<3>0 and 2<2>& with <2>,
<3> the links, <2>&, the loop, and 33, 22, 32 unmatched half links.
If the link is a 1-fold "axis" there are more unmatched half links
such as 332 and 222 in 332<1>222 of #201.

<p>
Pseudo-symmetry in the Group Graph column is denoted by a * following
the symbol such as 2* and m* for pseudo 2-fold axes and pseudo
mirrors, respectively.  For example in the above example we have
2*=332<1>222.  This * notation is consistent with the 2-color cubic
orbifold notation in Appendices A and B where symmetry and 
antisymmetry (i.e., pseudo symmetry) are discussed.

<p>
<a name="col5">Col. 5 - Wyckoff Set</a>
<p>
All space groups G, other than the last two cubics (#229 and #230)
have a normalizer N(G) which is a proper supergroup of G. For the
cubic space groups, all normalizers (n.b., affine = Euclidean here) 
are other cubic space groups.  A Wyckoff set is the set of Wyckoff
positions that are interchanged by the normalizer group N(G).

<p>
Each row in the table denotes a Wyckoff set that will contain one or
more equal but distinct Wyckoff sites.  The Wyckoff site notation of
<i>International Tables For Crystallography, Volume A, Space-Group
Tables</i>, T. Hahn, Ed. (1992) is used.  It is often necessary to
divide a Wyckoff site into sub regions denoted by numbers following
the Wyckoff letter. For example, the 3-axis 'e' in #196 is partitioned 
into 4 components, e1, e2, e3 and e4. The required partitioning is 
much more apparent with orbifold drawings than it is with space group 
symmetry drawings.

<p>
In the Wyckoff Set column, the Wyckoff point, line, plane, and 3-space
sites are ordered hierarchically with points as subcomponents of lines,
lines and points as subcomponents of planes, etc. There are also
footnotes attached to the first half of the cubic space groups to help
clarify the correlation between space-group geometry and orbifold
singular-set topology.

<p>
<a name="col6">Col. 6 - Origins of Pseudo-Symmetry (2[4] Covers)</a>
<p>
For the non-characteristic Wyckoff sets, the second (or fourth order
if necessary) supergroup that has the corresponding characteristic
orbit is given for the univariant and divariant limiting lattice
complexes.

<p>
A special cubic group/subgroup table, with pointer just above the
"clickable" 6 by 6 main entry table for the cubic space group
orbifolds, is also clickable.  That table provides a mechanism for
surfing the orbifold tables by second order subgroups or supergroups
(i.e., those which have solid connecting arcs).  Fourth (dashed
connecting arc)order group/subgroup relationships are also shown but
not clickable.  See our chapter on cubic groups/subgroups for a
detailed description of the table.  Only the cubic entries in the
group/subgroup table are clickable.

Notes on Heegaard Splitting Table
</h2></center>

Crystal Structures are represented as Morse function critical nets 
which are the topological critical points and interconnecting 
separatrix lines of overlapping Gaussian atomic thermal-motion density
functions within the crystal.  An orbifold contains one wrapped-up
(orbifolded) asymmetric unit (fundamental domain) of the crystal
structure which must be topologically compatible with the singular set
of the orbifold.  Minimum gradient separatrix lines go downhill
between adjacent peak-pass, pass-pale, and pale-pit pairs of critical
points and maximum gradient ones connect adjacent peak-pit pairs.

<p>
A smooth surface intersecting all pass-pale lines without intersecting
peak-pass and pale-pit lines or critical points is a Heegaard surface.
This surface characterizes the crystal structure and is ideally a
constant density (level) surface.  Enumerating the set of irreducible
Heegaard surfaces is a classical approach for characterizing the
topology of a manifold (or orbifold).  This corresponds to finding a
basis set of different real or conceptual simple critical nets for
each space group expressed in terms of Heegaard surfaces, which is the
goal in mind, with possible application is crystal structure 
prediction.

<p>
Heegaard splitting along the Heegaard surface divides an orientable
Euclidean 3-orbifold into two orientable handlebody 3-orbifolds.  For
non-orientable (i.e., centrosymmetric space group) Euclidean
3-orbifolds the two parts are called compression bodies, or (if there
are no boundary components present) non-orientable handlebodies.  For
each case, one component contains the peak and pass critical points 
and the other contains the pales and pits.  
<p>

Critical net drawings for most of the cubic structures in the atlas
are shown in the lattice complex chapter.  The Heegaard surface in
such drawings is a plane midway up the drawing and parallel to the
bottom edge.

<p>
The three example splittings for #196 ,i.e., (a) ZnS, (b) NaCl, and
(c) FCC, yield the orientable handlebody 3-orbifold pairs with group
graphs (a) two 32<3>32, (b) two 33<2>33, and (c) 32<3>2<3>32 +
332<1>22.  However, this handlebody group-graph information is not
listed explicitly in the current orbifold atlas.  Instead we provide
information on the type of invariant lattice complexes sites occupied
by each critical point.  For instance in the above example we have:
peak / pass /pale / pit = (a) FF / T / T / FF, (b) FF / J<sub>2</sub>
/ J<sub>2</sub> / FF, and (c) FFF / TT / J<sub>2</sub> / F.
Information on the Heegaard surface 2-orbifold nomenclature and its
approximate positioning within the 3-orbifold also is given.

<p>
<a name="col1b">Col. 1b - Structure and Multiplicity (Struct-Mult)</a>
<p>
Structure types include generic types such as body and face centered
cubic (BCC, FCC), simple cubic (SCub), diamond (Diam), as well as
specific chemical formuli such as NaCl, CsCl, NaTl, ZnS, etc.  Certain
hypothetical structure types use the peak site lattice complex symbol
such as Y** in #230.  The dual (interchanging peak/pass/pale/pit with
pit/pale/pass/peak) of Y** is S, and the dual of FCC is
Li<sub>2</sub>O.

<p>
Here a multiplicity of n means that the relevant Wyckoff set
multiplicities of the orbifold allow the complete critical net of the
structure to be imbedded in n equivalent but different orientations, 
thus there are n equivalent Heegaard surfaces.  An s following the
multiplicity signifies symmetric splitting.  For example, the high
Wyckoff set multiplicities for orbifold #196 allows multiplicity two
for the symmetric ZnS splitting, multiplicity one for the symmetric
NaCl splitting, and multiplicity four for the asymmetric FCC
splitting.

<p>
<a name="col2b">Col. 2b - Critical Points </a> 
<p>
The critical points are tabulated in the sequence peaks / passes /
pales / pits.  In the #196 example ZnS and NaCl have their peak + pit
critical points on invariant lattice complex point of type F, but the
two structures have their passes + pales on lattice complex points of
types T and J<sub>2</sub>, respectively.  The FCC derivative in this
example (#196) has 1 peak, 1 pass, 2 pales and 3 pits.

<p>
<a name="col3b">Col. 3b - Heegaard Surface (Heegaard Surf) </a> 
<p>
A Heegaard surface in a Euclidean 3-orbifold is occasionally an
Euclidean 2-orbifold but more often is a hyperbolic 2-orbifold.
Nomenclature for the hyperbolic 2-orbifolds is similar to that of the
spherical (point group) and Euclidean (plane group) 2-orbifolds.  The
nomenclature is determined by noting the boundary mirrors, n'-axes in
boundary mirrors, n-axes, and all pass-pale separatrix lines which
intersect the Heegaard surface.  We record the first three as
2-orbifold boundaries, dihedral corners, and cone points,
respectively.  We then calculate the Euler characteristic X from those
elements and distinguish the hyperbolic and Euclidean cases by noting
if X is < 0 or = 0, respectively.

<p>
For example, the Heegaard surface entry H3232{11} for ZnS in #196
denotes a hyperbolic (H) surface with four cone points (3232).  The
{11} indicates that two (nonsingular) pass-pale lines pass through the
Heegaard surface.  This information can often be obtained directly
from the corresponding critical net drawing in the chapter on critical
nets.  This nomenclature scheme is under review and may be replaced by
something that reflects the two-sided character of Heegaard surfaces.

<p>
<a name="col4b">Col. 4b - Wyckoff Cut </a> 
<p>
The Wyckoff elements cut by the Heegaard surface are listed in this
column.  Sometimes a element may be cut twice and this is indicated by
dividing the element into subcomponent, as indicated in the trailing
number, and listing all relevant subcomponents.  For example, the FCC
Heegaard splitting in #196 has four different Wyckoff cut sets,
because the multiplicity is four, but only one of the four is listed
(e1 e2 g f1 f2).  The Wyckoff 3-axis e is already partitioned into
four parts (e1 e2 e3 e4) in the figure because a 3-axis automatically
continues through a 332 node as discussed in our web tutorial; but f
is shown as a single link in the figure.  Thus we must conceptually
partition f into two equal parts, f1 and f2, then cut each sub
partition.  Thus the Heegaard surface is a triangular tunnel going
along the base (e1 e2 f) of the tetrahedra entering at the f e3 e4
face and chopping off the e1 e2 g vertex.

<p>
The Heegaard surfaces for the ZnS and NaCl examples in #196 
are simple normal surface quadralateral planes which cut 
through two pairs of opposite edges in the tetrahedra.  The FCC 
example can be made into a normal surface problem by subdividing the
tetrahedron into sub-tetrahedra, but that is a piece-wise linear
combinatorial topology approach and we prefer to use smooth manifold
methods when posssible.
