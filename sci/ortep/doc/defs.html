<a name="addrpt"><b>Addressable Point</b></a>
<p> 
An addressable point in the crystal is any point for which an 
<A HREF="#adc">atom designator code</A>
exists. In general, the addressable region is
a 9 <img src="cross.gif"> 9 <img src="cross.gif"> 9 block of unit cells.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="adc"><b>Atom Designator Code (ADC)</b></a>
<p> 
In order to
specify a particular atom in the crystal within a reasonable distance
from the crystallographically defined origin, the following
five-component atom designator code (ADC) is used.
<p>
<center>
ADC = AN <img src="cross.gif"> 10<sup>5</sup> + 
(TA + 5) <img src="cross.gif"> 10<sup>4</sup> +
(TB + 5) <img src="cross.gif"> 10<sup>3</sup> + 
(TC + 5) <img src="cross.gif"> 10<sup>2</sup> + SN
</center>
<p>
where
<p>
AN = atom number (0  <img src="leq.gif"> AN  <img src="leq.gif"> 
NATOM  <img src="leq.gif"> 500)  - the numerical position of the
atom in the input list of atoms, which contains
NATOM atoms. Atom 0 is not in the input list but refers to the
crystal origin point (0., 0., 0.).
<p>
TA,TB,TC = crystal lattice translation digits - cell translations along
cell edges <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>, respectively. Each digit in an ADC can range
from 1 to 9; consequently, it is possible to move up to 4 cells in any
direction from the origin cell 555.
<p>
SN = symmetry operator number (0  <img src="leq.gif"> SN  
<img src="leq.gif"> NSYM  <img src="leq.gif"> 96) - the numerical position
of the symmetry operator in the input list of symmetry operators, which
contains NSYM entries. Symmetry operator 0 is not in the
input list but refers to an identity operator. However, the identity
operation (corresponding to position x,y,z) generally must be
somewhere in the input symmetry operator list and is usually the first
operator.
<p>
<i>Example</i>: An atom designator code of 347502 refers to atom 3 moved
through symmetry operation 2, then translated -1 cell translation along
<b>a</b>, +2 cell translations along <b>b</b>, and 0 cell translations along <b>c</b>.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="adr"><b> Atom Designator Run (ADR)</b></a>
<p> 

A straight run sequence of atoms can be defined using two 
<A HREF="#adc">atom designator codes</A>
with a "-" preceding the second of the two. The run
hierarchy is: first, atom number AN; second, symmetry operator number
SN; third, <b>a</b> translation TA; fourth, <b>b</b> translation TB; and last, <b>c</b>
translation TC.
<p> 
<i>Example</i>: ADR (145502-245603) will generate the 8-atom run 145502, 245502,
145503, 245503, 145602, 245602, 145603, 245603.
<p>
Exceptions allowed in the "origin" ADRs of
instructions 101, 102, 402/412, 403/413, and 404/414 <b>only</b>:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The minus sign may be eliminated.
<li> If the second atom in the atom designator run has the same symmetry
and translation components as the first atom, the second atom may 
be represented by its atom number component alone.
<li> If the symmetry and translation components of both atoms are 55501,
both atoms may be represented by their atom number components alone.
<p>
<i>Example</i>:  ADR (345502-745502) may also
be represented as (345502 745502) or (345502 7). ADR (355501-755501)
may also be represented as (355501 755501) or (355501 7) or (3 7).
</ul>
<p>

<a name="af"><b> Atom Feature</b></a>
<p> 
An atom feature is a user-defined characteristic of a group of atoms that may be
assigned to the atoms in the ORTEP input as needed for a given task. For example, the atomic
number may be provided with each atom to make selecting atoms of the same element easier.
Up to two features may be assigned to each atom. These are referred to as Feature #1 and
Feature #2.
<p> 
<hr>
<a name="anr"><b> Atom Number Run (ANR)</b></a>
<p> 
An atom number run is a subset of the 
<A HREF="#adr">atom designator run</A>.
In this
case, only the atom number AN changes. Normally, an ANR is entered by
using only the atom number values for the first and last members of the
sequence without a "-".
<p>
<i>Example</i>: (1 4) will designate atoms 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the input list.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="boe"><b> Box of Enclosure </b></a>
<p>
A box of enclosure is a parallelepiped that can be centered about any
<A HREF="#addrpt">addressable point</A>
and assigned arbitrary dimensions.
The orientation depends upon either the unit cell axes (triclinic box of
enclosure) or the reference axes (rectangular box of enclosure).
The box of enclosure can have
a <b>complete population</b>, a <b>partial population</b>,
or a <b>vector screened population</b>
as described for the 
<a href="#soe">sphere of enclosure</a>.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="fnr"><b>Feature Number Run (FNR)
</b></a>
<p>
A feature number run is used to identify those atoms having a particular 
<a href="#af">atom feature</a> within a specified value range.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="nr"><b>Number Run (NR) and Number Run Type
</b></a>
<p>
A number run is a generic term that refers to both <A HREF="#anr">atom
number runs (ANR)</A> and <A HREF="#fnr">feature number runs
(FNR)</A>.  The number run type identifies the number run. Number run
type 0 refers to an ANR, type 1 refers to an FNR on Feature #1, and
type 2 refers to an FNR on Feature #2.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="pp"><b>
Prime Parameters and Primer Constants
</b></a>
<p>
The more basic among the many settable
parameters in ORTEP are the prime parameters. The 
default values assigned to these
prime parameters are often similar or identical from one problem to the
next. Among the first things ORTEP does is a call to subroutine PRIME,
which sets as many prime parameters as possible to reasonable default
primer constant values.  For example, the maximum plot dimensions
(instruction 301) are set to 10.5 in. for X and 8.0 in.
for Y, and the overall scale for plotting (instruction
600 series) is set to 1.0 in./&Aring;. If the value assigned to a
particular constant by the PRIME subroutine is satisfactory, the user
does not have to reset this constant with ORTEP instructions.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="coord"><b>
Reference, Working, and Standard Cartesian Coordinate Systems
</b></a>
<p>
Many of the ORTEP calculations use fractional coordinates based
on the crystal axes <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> (triclinic coordinate system);
but other steps necessitate the introduction of orthonormal base vector
triplets (Cartesian coordinate systems). Two Cartesian systems, reference
and working, are utilized.  The reference (major) system is used for all
operations except plotting, where the working (minor) system is used.
For a right-eye or left-eye stereo view, the working system is moved
from the reference system by rotation about an axis of the reference
system. However, certain decisions made while plotting must still be
referred to the reference system to maintain accurate stereopsis. The
user can define and orient the two Cartesian systems through the series
500 instructions. Until a 500-series instruction is given, a "standard
Cartesian system" is utilized for both the reference and working
systems. The orthonormal base vectors of the standard system are
oriented as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
x axis along <b>a</b>,
<p>
y axis along (<b>a</b> <img src="cross.gif"> <b>b</b>) <img src="cross.gif"> <b>a</b>,
<p>
z axis along (<b>a</b> <img src="cross.gif"> <b>b</b>) = <b>c</b>*,
</blockquote>
<p>
where <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> are crystal axes and 
<img src="cross.gif"> denotes the outer vector
product (cross product). The symbol <b>c</b>* refers to a reciprocal axis.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="soe"><b> Sphere of Enclosure </b></a>
<p>
A sphere of enclosure specifies some or all of the atoms lying within a
sphere of radius D<sub>max</sub> 
about a given "origin" atom without the necessity
of delineating each atom individually. The sphere of enclosure is said
to contain a <b>complete population</b> if all addressable atoms within the
D<sub>max</sub> radius are included. If 
the sphere of enclosure contains only
certain types of atoms that are derived from a group of sequential
atoms in the input list or atoms having particular 
<a href="#af">features</a>, then the sphere is said to have a <b>partial
population</b>.  Finally, the population (complete or partial) of the
sphere of enclosure can be screened as selectively as desired through
the use of 
<A HREF="#vsc">vector search codes</A>,
and the resulting content is
called a <b>vector screened population</b>.
<p>
A sphere of enclosure can be centered on any addressable atom, but the
origin atom should not be chosen in the outermost cells because of the
possibility of having nonaddressable points within the <br>
D<sub>max</sub> radius.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="vdc"><b> Vector Designator Code (VDC)</b></a>
<p> 
A vector direction is specified by two 
<A HREF="#adc">atom designator codes</A>.
The
vector direction is from the first to the second.
<p> 
<i>Example</i>: 253704 263704 is a vector along the positive <b>a</b> direction of
the crystal lattice.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="vsc"><b> Vector Search Code (VSC) </b></a>
<p>
A vector search code consists of two 
<A HREF="#nr">number runs</A>
and a distance
range. It is used for finding interatomic distances that have a
particular chemical significance, such as covalent and coordination
bonds.
<p>
<i>Example</i>: Suppose that metal atoms are numbers 1 and 2 in the atom list,
oxygen atoms are 6-12, and the interatomic distance range between
metals and oxygens is 1.9 &Aring; to 2.4 &Aring;. The metal-to-oxygen vectors can be
specified by the vector search code (1 2) (6 12) (1.9 2.4). Several
variations of this basic code are used in the program.
<p>
The vector searches in ORTEP-III for the 
<a href="i100.html">100 instructions</a> and
<a href="i400.html">400 instructions</a>
have been generalized to allow both
<a href="defs.html#anr">atom number runs</a> and
<a href="defs.html#fnr">feature number runs</a> with the
<a href="defs.html#nr">number run type</a> specified in column 24.
In addition, it is no longer necessary to specify all three screening 
ranges found
on this card (i.e., origin, target, and distance range). 
Any ranges not specified (i.e., zero or blank in the maximum value entry)
are omitted from the screening.
If there is more than one vector
search card, the parameter LOGC controls the logic of the screening.
If the value is "0" (the default), an atom satisfying the
screening conditions on 
any one of the No. 2 trailer cards will be retained
(i.e., it is a logical union of the results).  If the value
is "1", an atom must satisfy the screening conditions on all
the cards to be retained
(i.e., it is an intersection of the results).
If a value of "1" is needed for LOGC, a "1" is placed in column 27
of a Format No. 1 trailer card that goes between the main instruction
card and the Format No. 2 VSC cards. If the value for LOGC is "0", the
Format No. 1 card is not needed.
