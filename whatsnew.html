<p> 
For compatibility with existing ORTEP data sets, ORTEP-III retains ALL the
functionality of OR TEP-II, released in 1976.  New capabilities include:

<ul>
<li><a href="#user">User Interface</a>
<li><a href="#scrn">Screen Display</a>
<li><a href="#prnt">Output Formats</a>
<li><a href="#colr">Color</a>
<li><a href="#edit">Interactive Editor</a>
<li><a href="#comm">Comments</a>
<li><a href="#altf">Alternate Formats for Atomic Parameters</a>
<li><a href="#feat">Atom "Features"</a>
<li><a href="#crit">Critical Net Illustrations</a>
<li><a href="#symm">Symmetry Operators</a>

</ul>
<p>
Further details on many of these items may be found in the
<a href="doc/overview.html">Overview and Operation</a> section of the
Online Documentation.

<a name="user"><b>User Interface</b></a>
<p>

ORTEP-III is a semi-interactive program that requests certain information
from the user while the program executes. A default value for each item
requested
is provided in square brackets, and it will be used if the user simply
hits the RETURN key (on some keyboards, the name of this key is
ENTER).  
On systems that distinguish upper and lower case,
care must be
taken when entering file names to provide the correct case of the letters.
<hr>
<a name="scrn"><b>Screen Display</b></a>
<P>

The screen drawing subroutines available in ORTEP-III use PGPLOT.
PGPLOT is a free graphics library developed by T. J. Pearson at the
California Institute of Technology.  The package is written in FORTRAN
and operates on a variety of platforms. Information about PGPLOT can be
found on the World Wide Web at 
<a href="http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot">http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot</a>
or
via e-mail to <a href="mailto:tjp@astro.caltech.edu">tjp@astro.caltech.edu</a>.

<hr>
<a name="prnt"><b>Output Formats</b></a>
<P>
Illustrations generated by ORTEP-III can be saved as Encapsulated
Postscript or Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HPGL/2)
files.  The files may be
printed directly on a wide variety of printers and plotters or may be imported
into a number of computer programs that accept these formats.
<hr>
<a name="colr"><b>Color</b></a>
<p>
By default, ORTEP-III plots its illustrations in black on a white background. 
The new 204 instruction allows color to be added to the illustrations if the output
device supports color. Once a color is set, it remains in effect until another 204 instruction
changes the color. A 204 with no parameter (or a "0") returns the plotting color to black
(or pen #1).  The screen and Postscript drivers built into ORTEP-III
define color value 2 as red, 3 as green, 4 as blue, 5 as cyan, 6 as magenta, and 7 as yellow.
<hr>
<a name="edit"><b>Interactive Editor</b></a>
<p>

ORTEP-III provides a simple 
<a href="doc/overview.html#edit">line editor</a> for editing the input file
without exiting the program.  When the editor is invoked, the
instruction set from the input file is displayed on the screen with
line numbers (#) along with the editor commands.

<pre>
C=Change line #                         D=Delete line(s) # [#]
I=Insert line before #                  T=Type line(s) [#] [#]
S=Save modified instruction set         O=Restore original instruction set
P=Save drawing as Postscript            H=Save drawing as HPGL
R=Redraw structure on screen            Q=Quit
</pre>
<hr>
<a name="comm"><b>Comments</b></a>
<p>

In previous versions of ORTEP, Format No. 3 trailer cards were the only
means of placing comments in the input file. This method still works in
ORTEP-III, but a new method also exists. Among the ORTEP instructions,
any line beginning with # is treated as a comment and is totally
ignored by the program. Such comments can only go in the instruction
portion of the input data and only at places where a new instruction
could begin, i.e., comments can not go between instructions and their
trailer (continuation) cards. CAUTION:  These comment lines are not
printed in the ORTEP output file, and they are lost if the input file
is edited with ORTEP-III's line editor.

<hr>
<a name="altf"><b>Alternate Formats for Atomic Parameters</b></a>
<p>

ORTEP-III provides a way to input atom parameters that are available in
a "nonstandard" format. If the sentinel value
(column 1) on the last symmetry card in the ORTEP input file is "2"
instead of "1", the program asks the user for the name of a file
containing the atom parameters and branches to subroutine READIN to
read the information.  This subroutine may be recoded to read any
desired format.
<hr>
<a name="feat"><b>Atom "Features"</b></a>
<p>

In earlier versions of ORTEP, atoms could be referenced only by their
numeric positions in the input file; and 
<a href="doc/defs.html#anr">atom number runs (ANR)</a> were
used to select groups of atoms to be treated in the same manner.
ORTEP-III allows two optional attributes called
"features" to be included with each atom, and
<a href="doc/defs.html#fnr">feature number runs (FNR)</a>
can be used to select groups of atoms having
particular features.  To handle features, 
a new parameter, <a href="doc/defs.html#nr">number run type</a>,
has been added to the 
100 series, 400 series, 505, 506, 700 series, 800 series, and 1001 
instructions.
Features should prove especially useful for
polymeric materials such as proteins or nucleic acids and for
<a href="#crit">critical net illustrations</a>.
<hr>
<a name="crit"><b>Critical Net Illustrations</b></a>
<p>
ORTEP-III can produce 
<a href="doc/overview.html#crit">critical net illustrations</a>
that depict some canonical
topological characteristics of the global ensemble of overlapping atomic-thermal-motion
Gaussian density functions in a crystal.
Click <a href="examples/examples.html#crit">here</a> for examples.
<hr>
<a name="symm"><b>Symmetry Operators</b></a>
<p>
The symmetry operators in the ORTEP input file may now be provided in a free
format using the xyz coordinate triplet notation found in the International Tables for
Crystallography. ORTEP is informed that this style for the symmetry operators is being used
by having a "1" in column 1 of the cell parameter card. (A "0" or blank in that position
indicates the old style is being used.)
<p>
Symmetry cards using this style do not have a specific format with the following two
exceptions: (1) the symmetry information on each card must not go beyond column 72, and
(2) column 1 must be blank on all symmetry cards other than the last one in the set, which
must have a non-zero value in column 1. Below is an example set of symmetry cards to
illustrate the flexibility of this style.
<p>
<pre>
             X,Y,Z
             X   -Y   Z+1/2
             X+0.5,  .5+Y,  Z
             x+1/2,-y+1/2,1/2+z
</pre>
<p>
As shown, letters may be either upper or lower case. Commas or spaces may be used
to separate the components of the triplet. The three components may not have spaces within
them.  Decimal fractions may be used with or without an initial 0. Fractions may precede or
follow the letters.
