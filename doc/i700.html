700 Series Instructions: Atom Plotting
</H2>
</center>
<p> 
<hr>
<p> 
These instructions produce various representations of the atom based on
the familiar ball-and-stick molecular model. In the general
case, the ball is an ellipsoid representing a contour surface of equal
probability density of thermal
motion displacement. Alternatively, when thermal motion is not being
portrayed, the ball can be a sphere of arbitrary dimension.
The 700
series also has provision for labeling the atomic site with the
corresponding chemical symbol.
<p>
The instructions in this series draw the
atoms in the ATOMS array that project onto the usable part of the
drawing area, defined with a
<a href="i300.html#301">301 instruction</a>. 
Atoms found to be out of bounds are bypassed, and a 
<a href="faults.html">fault
message</a> (NG = 10) is printed in the ORTEP output file. An atom is out
of bounds under the following conditions:  (1) if its z coordinate in
the scaled 
<a href="defs.html#coord">reference Cartesian system</a>
is greater than 1/2 the viewing
distance, (2) if its center after projection falls outside the limiting
boundary of the drawing board, or (3) if the projected center falls
in the outermost
3/4 of the drawing margin.
<p>
An ellipsoid, for graphical purposes in ORTEP, is considered to be
composed of ellipses and straight lines. The ellipses are of two
types--principal ellipses and boundary ellipses. Relative to the
viewpoint, a principal ellipse is further subdivided into a front half
and a back, or hidden, half. There are three principal ellipses per
ellipsoid, corresponding to the three principal planes. The boundary
ellipse is the edge of the ellipsoid as seen from the viewpoint. The
front and back halves of the principal ellipses meet at the boundary
ellipse.  The straight-line segments of the ORTEP ellipsoid are the
forward principal axes, reverse principal axes, and octant-shading
lines.
<p>
Various combinations of these elements along with the
ORTEP instruction number and parameter values to produce each
are seen by clicking <a href="ellipsoid.gif">here</a>. It is
obvious that certain of these combinations are better representations
than others. 
Instructions 701, 702, 703,
and 706 generate specific ellipsoid types as shown.
Instruction 704 draws the boundary ellipse alone. If an atom is entered
as a sphere, the boundary will be circular before projection and
slightly elliptical after perspective projection.
Instruction 705 allows the user to make up any
representation from the basic components. 
<p>
Chemical symbols up to six alphanumeric characters in length are
included with the input structural parameters for each atom. These
symbols can be put onto the illustration with one 700 series or several
<a href="i900.html">900 series instructions</a>.
The 700 series places the center of the six-character
field of each atom in the same position relative to the atom
center; the 900 series allows the user to position each symbol
individually. The 700 series requires only three parameters as follows:
(1) symbol height in inches, (2) parallel (left/right) offset from
the atom center in
inches, and (3) perpendicular (up/down) offset in inches. The
parameters refer to the model before projection, and they will change
slightly during perspective projection. The parallel and perpendicular
offset refer to the exact center of the six-character input field and
are relative to the lettering base line set up with the 
<a href="i300.html#302">302 instruction</a>.
A symbol height of 0 or blank will cause the symbol drawing
routine to be bypassed.
<p>
In order to distinguish certain atoms, such as those in disordered
positions, a 705/715 instruction with NPLANE = 4, NDOT = 3, 4, 5, or 6,
NLINE = 0, and NDASH = 0 may be used to produce dotted boundary
ellipses to contrast with the normal solid line boundary ellipses.
Another feature of the 705/715 instruction is that if NPLANE = 0 and
the symbol height is greater than zero, then chemical symbols alone are
drawn on the atomic sites.
<p>

It is possible to vary the thickness of the boundary ellipse line by
making it a function of z, the height of the atom from the drawing
board. This option is normally used with the 704 (boundary only)
instruction but will work for any 700 instruction. Entries are put in
the A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub>
fields of the instruction continuation card to specify the coefficients
of

<p>
<center>
<img src="delta.uc.gif">R(z) = A<sub>0</sub> 
+ A<sub>1</sub>z ,
</center>
<p>
where
<img src="delta.uc.gif">R is the increase in radial dimension to
be added to the width of the single pen line, A<sub>0</sub> 
is <img src="delta.uc.gif">R for an atom
at z = 0, and A<sub>1</sub> is the rate of increase in
radial dimension with z.

<p>

<i>Example</i>: Assume that the atoms of the scaled model range from 5 in.
below to 5 in. above the drawing board and the pen width is 0.2 mm
(.008 in.). If we want the closest ellipse boundary to be five times as
wide as the farthest, then <img src="delta.uc.gif">R(-5 in.) = 0,
<img src="delta.uc.gif">R(5) = 0.008 <img src="cross.gif">
(5 - 1) = 0.032 in.; thus
A<sub>0</sub> = 0.016 in. and A<sub>1</sub> = 0.0032 in.

<p>
The program widens the line by stepping radially in increments of DISP,
which is set by 
<a href="defs.html#pp">primer constant</a> to 0. in. A 
<a href="i300.html#303">303 instruction</a> must be used
to give DISP a positive value for this thickening process to work.
<p>
Selected types of atoms from the ATOMS array can be drawn without
having to alter the contents of the array. This is accomplished by
using a 
<a href="defs.html#nr">number run (NR)</a> code that 
includes the atoms that
are to be drawn with a particular 700-series instruction. This feature
is particularly useful when two or more different representations are
used, such as for the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the 
<a href="../cubane/cubane.html">cubane example</a>.
If no NR is entered, then all atoms in the table are drawn.
<p>
The ORTEP file output for the 701-706 instructions consists of the
following:
<p>
1. x,y plotter coordinates: the coordinates, in inches, for the
projected atom center on the plot, measured from the lower left-hand
corner of the limiting boundary. This is the fixed plotter coordinate
system with origin point set by the plotter driver.
<p>
2. x,y,z working Cartesian coordinates: the coordinates, in inches, for
the oriented and scaled atomic model before projection. The x and y
axes parallel the plotter x and y axes, and the origin of the system is
in the plane of the plotter at the point X0,Y0 in plotter
coordinates. The point ORGN of the scaled model is at this point.
<p>
3. x,y,z triclinic coordinates, in fractions of the unit-cell edges
relative to the crystal unit-cell origin.
<p>
4. Principal axes of thermal motion, consisting of (a) principal values
of root-mean-square displacement and (b) direction cosine for principal
vectors relative to the working Cartesian system.
<p>
5. The 
<a href="defs.html#adc">atom designator code</a> and chemical 
symbol for the atom.
<p>
Instructions 711-716 are identical to 701-706 except that the 71x series
suppresses all ORTEP file output except fault messages.
