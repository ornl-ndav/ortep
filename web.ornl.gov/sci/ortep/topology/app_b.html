Appendix B<br>
Elliptic 2-Orbifold Covers<br>
</H2>
</center>
<hr>

Figs. B.1-B.5 are related to those shown in Sect. 2 but include the
details of the elliptic orbifold cover, L, that unfolds the orbifold, G, to
the suborbifold, H. The antisymmetry (white operators) give the
details of the cover folding.
In all cases, the orbifolds G and H are also shown to
clarify in the following figures
the graphic symbolism.  Sets of these color orbifolds can be
used to construct the singular set of the Euclidean 3-orbifold cover
associated with the Euclidean group/subgroup transformations.  We
anticipate that they will mainly be helpful for the more complex
situations where the covering details are sometimes difficult to
understand such as in certain order-3 cubic to orthorhombic
transformations.  At present, we have not worked out suitable graphical
conventions
for drawing axes of the full three-dimensional cover when there are
mixed black and white orders such as the 4-fold white and 2-fold black
combination.

<p>
Figs.  B.1, B.2, and B.3 illustrate 17 examples for the 15 families of
bicolor elliptic 2-orbifolds,
based on the 7 topology families belonging to
the cyclic (d,e,f) and dihedral (g,h,i,j) point groups.  Each member of
the bicolor point group represents a group/normal-subgroup (G/H) pair of
regular point groups, with the regular orbifold arising from the point
group G. 

<p>
One group representation from the orthorhombic-tetrahedral cluster
(i.e., from the bottom layer of <a href="app_a.html#figa2">Fig. A.2</a>)
is shown on the left
of Figs. B.1-B.3, and one to three regular orbifolds (H), from
corresponding subgroups, on the top or bottom of the
figures.  The bicolor orbifold within the table is labeled G:H and has
both black (symmetry) and white (antisymmetry) components.  The H
suborbifold is seen by ignoring the white (i.e., outlined) orbifold
elements, and the G orbifold is seen by considering all elements to be
equally valid.

<p>
The simplest examples are [hd] 4'4':44 in Fig. B.2 and [jg] 4'2'2':422
in Fig. B.3 for which only the mirrors have antisymmetry.  Next in
complexity are [dd] 44:22 and [ff] 41':21' in Fig. B.1 where a
90<sup>o</sup> rotation has antisymmetry, but the
second order 180<sup>o</sup> has regular symmetry.
This also occurs with [hh] 4'4':2'2' of Fig. B.3 except that in this
case the angle between the mirrors reduces from 90<sup>o</sup>
to 45<sup>o</sup>, and you simply
have to ignore one of the original outside mirror symbols.  Similarly,
with [gg] 422:222 of Fig. B.3 where a new 2-fold axis becomes active,
we ignore one of the original black 2-folds.  

<p>
In practice, we do not simply "ignore" the doubled symbols since the
chief application is analyzing the changes in the singular set in pairs
of Euclidean 3-orbifolds.  The doubling of the orbifold symbol
accompanies a doubling of the original fundamental domain in the group
to subgroup transformation.

<p>
The most complex symbols involve the projective plane [fe] 41':20 in
Fig.  B.1 and [ie] 22':20 in Fig.  B.2, but the detailed symbolism can
be deduced from the triads of symbols.
