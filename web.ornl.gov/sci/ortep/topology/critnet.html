<b>Crystallographic Morse Function</b>
<p>
Our model for the crystallographic Morse function is based on concepts
familiar to crystallographers who must deal with crystallographic
three-dimensional density functions on a frequent basis.  The crystallographic
observations are in the domain of Bragg reflection intensities which, after
solving the phase problem, become Fourier coefficients in a three
dimensional summation that gives the density at any chosen point.  The
density may be electron density or nucleus thermal motion density depending
on the type of Bragg diffraction intensities,  
x-ray or neutron.
<p>
A 3-dimensional grid of
density values can be calculated on which an
interpolated equidensity contour map is drawn.
This is
then interpreted in terms of atom positions that are smeared out by a
combination of thermal motion (Johnson and Levy, 1974)
and electron orbital quantum chemistry
effects (Coppens, 1996).  Once the atoms are found, a reverse Fourier transform 
calculation
is carried out based on the atom positions and the functions that describe the
smearing factors to get calculated Fourier amplitudes, which can then be
compared with the observations. The various parameters for position and
smearing are adjusted in a least-squares calculation.
<p>
The thermal motion smearing factor most often used is the 3-dimensional
normal probability density function, which is also called the Gaussian
density function.  The density function for an individual atom may be
either isotropic with spherical equidensity contours or anisotropic with
ellipsoidal equidensity contours, depending on the site symmetry for the
atom within the crystal 
With neutron diffraction, there is no extra
smearing due to the electron orbitals within an atom since neutrons are
primarily scattered by the point-like nucleus of an atom and not by the
electrons.  For x-rays the situation is reversed and an atomic form factor
is required in addition to the thermal motion density function. 
Since our crystallographic experimental interests center around
<a href="http://neutrons.ornl.gov">neutron diffraction</a>, we have less
interest in electron cloud effects than those scientists who specialize
in x-ray diffraction.
<p>
The Gaussian density function has tails that extend to infinity; hence with
positive scatterers, the summed density function within the crystal never goes
to zero.  Thus, the tails of the thermal motion density functions for all
the atoms in the entire crystal overlap, but the density between atoms is
considerably less than the density at the atomic sites.  This theoretical
global density function is the basic model on which we do critical point
analysis.  We completely ignore all quantum chemistry electron orbital
effects, many of which can in fact be observed in the experimental electron
density map of x-ray diffraction
when great care is taken in the experimental data collection
and correction stages of the analysis. 
A topological interpretation of the quantum chemistry effects is given in
Bader (1991).
<p>
Mildly overlapping Gaussian density functions in a space group provide a
smooth infinitely differentiable function involving Hermite polynomials
and is ideally suited for Morse
theory.  The atom centroid (mean or
first moment of the normal probability density
function) is to a first approximation at a mode (extremum) of the density;
thus peak positions correspond with atom positions.  Our working hypothesis
is that all valid real stable crystal structures are Morse functions, which
by definition have no degenerate critical points.
<p>
<b>Morse Theory</b>
<p>
The first application of Morse theory to crystal physics was by
van Hove (1953), who showed that certain singularities in lattice
dynamics originate from crystallographic symmetry.
Morse theory has a nice qualitative treatment in El'sgol'c (1964).  The
standard mathematical references for Morse theory are
Morse (1938) and Milnor (1969); but our
application, which involves equivariant topology (Bierstone, 1980), seems
to require the treatment by Goresky and MacPherson (1983, 1988).  The
concepts of peak and pit are purely topological notions while the
saddle type critical points involve in a crucial way the differential
structure of the functional and the domain.  There are some recent ways of
dealing with critical points from non-smooth functionals (Fang, 1995), which
may be required in more formal analysis than we present here for Morse
functions on orbifolds.  
<p>
Orbifolds are not smooth manifolds except for the few instances involving
the 10 (or 13 depending on conventions used) examples of space groups
without fixed points.  Some formal results concerning Morse functions on
orbifolds are also starting to appear in the mathematical preprint
literature (e.g., Lerman and Tolman, 1995), but these are primarily based
on symplectic rather than Euclidean geometry (cf., Kirwan, 1984), which
is beyond our mathematical capabilities to extend into algebraic
geometry.
In our case we know the Euclidean space
analogues of our Morse functions on orbifolds are well behaved so we can
always unfold back to Euclidean 3-space for detailed analysis when
necessary.
<p>
<b>D-Symbol Tiling Alternative</b>
<p>
A technique related to our Morse function critical net approach is the
Delonay-Dress D-symbols method used by Dress, Huson,
and Molnar (1993) and Molnar (1994).
That method, which is currently more automated but also more restricted
in its crystallographic applicability than ours, uses topological space
tiling.  The space tiles are based on four types of special positions
interpretable as vertices, edges, faces, and centers of polyhedra.  The
method produces a decomposition of each polyhedron into component
simplex tetrahedra.  The critical
net and the D-symbol approaches lead to identical results in most cases
where their method is applicable.  
Additional details on the D-symbol approach are available on
<a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~huson">Huson's WWW page</a>.
<p>
We found some discrepancies between the Dress, Huson, 
and Molnar (1993) paper and
our results. Their "special rhombohedral" tiling example, which is not a
Morse function, is actually body-centered cubic based on vertex
positions as illustrated later in Fig. 3.4 
and <a href="critnet2.html#fig42">Fig. 4.2</a>.  Their
"covered rhombohedron" is not a Morse function either 
since there are not enough pales to fill all the faces. Our working
hypothesis is that all real crystal structures are Morse functions (i.e.,
they have no degenerate critical points).  Degenerate critical points
suggest structural instability which should be present only during
a phase transition.

<p>
<b>Chemical Faces and Cages</b>
<p>
A detailed list of critical net properties is given at the end of this
section.  The following chemically-oriented nomenclature allows
structural chemistry intuition to be used more easily in interpretation
of critical net drawings.  First, we note that peaks always represent
atoms and passes sometimes, but not always, represent chemical bonds.
We define a "chemical face" in a critical net as a disk containing one
pale bounded by a graph circuit containing alternating peak and pass
nodes with edges along their interconnecting separatrices lines.   A
"chemical cage" is defined as a configuration of chemical faces that
encloses one pit.  A chemical cage is a convex polyhedron only in
the simplest cases such as primitive cubic, body-centered cubic and 
face-centered cubic critical nets.
<p>
We could have used the term minimal-surface face instead of chemical face,
but that would require us to explore yet another major subfield of
topology [i.e., minimal surfaces, e.g., Pitts and Rubinstein (1995)].  
However, if the reader prefers to
interpret the critical net drawings in terms of mathematical
minimal surfaces rather
than more intuitive chemical surfaces, that interesting option is
available. 
<p> 
The universal geometric
pattern in critical nets is: (a) the three or more passes attached to a
pale will be approximately coplanar with the pale, and the approximately
plane-normal critical-net connection at the pale will go to two
pits, one on each
side; and (b) the three or more pales attached to a pass will be
approximately coplanar with the pass, and the approximately plane-normal
critical-net connection at the pass will go to two peaks,
one on each side.  It
is advisable to forgo all the distance and angle metric local detail 
so characteristic of
structural crystallography while doing crystallographic topology.
<p>
<b>Diamond Critical Net</b>
<p>
Fig. 3.1 is a stereoscopic drawing of one chemical cage and the
neighboring pits for the diamond structure. It has non-planar chemical
faces and thus the diamond chemical cage is not a convex polyhedron.  In
diamond, there is one unique tetrahedral chemical cage with chair-shaped
chemical faces. 
<p>
[Stereoscopic drawings are best viewed using an inexpensive stereo
viewer, such as that available from Edmund Scientific Co., Edscorp
Building, Barrington NJ 088007-1380, USA.  Fax 609-573-6295).  They
can also be viewed using "occular gymnastics" (i.e., by holding the
figure close to your eyes and then gradually moving the figure to a
normal reading distance).  High resolution copies of these stereoscopic
drawings are available as Postscript or HPGL files by clicking
<a href="../examples/examples.html#crit">here</a>.  The ORTEP input data
files in the same directory provide full crystallographic  and 
graphic details on the illustrations.]

<b>Graphite Critical Net</b>
<p>
The peak, pass, pale, and pit critical points for the P6<sub>3</sub>/mmc 
graphite structure, illustrated below in Fig.
3.2, are at Wyckoff sites b+c, a+h, d+g, and f (with z = -.03),
respectively.  Two chemical cages are shown in the graphite illustration
to clarify the packing arrangement, but only one is unique.  If one is
conditioned by training to always look for convex polyhedra with atoms
at the vertices, the single unique tetrahedral chemical cage with one
planar and three chair-shaped chemical faces might mistakenly be
interpreted as a hexagonal prism polyhedron with three of the vertex
atoms pinched together at one end of the prism.  The disturbing
feature of the prism
interpretation is the existence of a pseudo face of zero area in
the pinched end of the prism.  We call this the "graphite paradox".  All
the graphite chemical bonding is in the flat six membered chemical face
of the tetrahedron.

<b>Hexagonal Diamond Critical Net</b>
<p>
In addition to the cubic diamond and hexagonal graphite structures
shown above, there is a third simple carbon structure called hexagonal
diamond, which has the critical net illustrated in Fig. 3.3.  This
structure, which is not widly known since it is hard to find in
natural sources and is difficult to synthesize, crystallizes in the same
space group as graphite.  It has both boat- and chair-shaped six-membered
rings and two different chemical cages.  The graphite and
hexagonal diamond critical nets may seem quite different, but they
are topologically equivalent through duality as discussed later
in Sect. 5. and
<a href="lattice.html#fig53">Fig. 5.3</a>.

<b>BCC Critical Net</b>
<p>
A common critical net, body-centered cubic (bcc), is shown
in Fig. 3.4 and discussed in detail in Sect. 4. 
There is only one type of chemical cage, but again for packing
illustration, two are shown in the figure.  Bcc is the ultimate example
of warped chemical faces.  There are four puckered chemical faces,
each containing four peaks and four bonds.  The pales in the four faces
have a square planar arrangement about the pit, but the 6 peaks are
octahedral about the pit because of the vertex sharing arrangement.

Using the basic bcc elemental structure of space group Im<img

into the same basic structure.  For example, the Fd<img

two <img src="4bar.gif">3m sites as shown it Fig. 3.5.  This bcc
derivative is our Morse function alternative to the special
rhombohedron tiling of Dress, Huson and Molnar (1993).

<b>Y** Lattice Complex Critical Net</b>
<p>
The previous critical net drawings (Figs.  3.1-3.5) have four- or
six-atom chemical faces.  An example with five-atom chemical faces is the
Y** lattice complex shown in Fig. 3.6.  Four pentagonal chemical faces
join to form a tetrahedral chemical cage.

<b>FCC Critical Net</b>
<p>
The face-centered cubic critical net, shown in Fig. 3.7, has a
three-fold planar coordinations of peaks (and passes) around pales and,
in addition, has two independent face-sharing
chemical cages as adjoining
tetrahedral and octahedral convex polyhedra.
Only some of the pales are required by symmetry to be exactly in the 
plane of the chemical faces.

<b>Critical Net Characteristics</b>
<p>
Below are some definitive characteristics that are useful for finding
and analyzing
critical nets for very simple structures. For more complex
structures, critical point positions and the canonical paths joining
them can be determined numerically from calculated
global Gaussian thermal motion density maps based only on given
atomic (i.e., peak) positions. 
The author's ORCRIT program for
protein electron density map interpretation, originally written in 1977,
could be modified for that purpose.
High precision experimental
electron density maps from x-ray data and charge density maps
calculated by <i>ab initio</i> quantum chemistry programs are more
complicated than those considered here because of the possible
addition of new
critical points caused by bonding electrons etc.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Peaks are at atom positions.
<li>Pits are as far from all adjacent peaks as possible.
<li>A pass lies between two adjacent peaks.
<li>A pale lies between two adjacent pits.
<li>A pale lies on or close to the plane perpendicular to each adjacent
pass' unique axis (i.e., the symmetric cross section of the cigar-shaped 
pass).
<li>A pass lies on or close to the plane perpendicular to each adjacent
pale's unique axis (i.e., the plane of the pancake-shaped pale).
<li>Each fixed point Wyckoff position of the space group must contain a 
critical point of the crystal structure.
<li>Wyckoff positions with the cubic site symmetries for tetrahedral
(23, m<img src="3bar.gif"> and <img src="4bar.gif">3m) and octahedral 
(432 and m<img src="3bar.gif">m) groups
can only accommodate peaks or pits, not passes nor pales, because of
their body-diagonal 3-fold axes.  All of the other
32 - 5 = 27 possible point group
site symmetries in a space group can accommodate 
any of the four critical points.
<li>The critical net is composed of
interconnected "twisted Hs" with pairs of peaks and pits at the ends of
the two inclined non-parallel
uprights and a pass and a pale at the ends of the connecting
horizontal bar, which is the shortest vector between the two non-parallel
uprights. 
<li>The twisted-H torsion angle about the pass-pale vector
ranges from about 45<sup>o</sup> (e.g., bcc) to 90<sup>o</sup> (e.g., simple
cubic).
<li>Critical nets always maintain a peak-pass-pale-pit vs.
pit-pale-pass-peak duality, that is the naming of the critical point
sites can be reversed to produce a new valid Morse function.  For
example, the body-centered cubic structure with unit cell critical point
counts (2, 8, 12, 6) (i.e., the lattice complex "I") forms an "inverted"
dual structure (6, 12, 8, 2) called lattice complex "J*" if atoms are
removed from the bcc peak sites and added at the bcc pit sites.

<li>The number of peaks, passes, pales, and pits in a unit cell 
(or a "basic unit" [defined below]) obeys the Euler-Poincare relationship
for 
Euclidean space, i.e.,
<p>
<center>
peaks - passes + pales - pits = 0 .
</center>
<p>
<li>Conservative Morse function inequalities for the number of peaks, 
passes, pales, and pits in some closed space are:
<p>
<ul>
pits <img src="geq.gif"> 1<br>
peaks <img src="geq.gif"> 1<br>
pales - pits <img src="geq.gif"> 0<br>
passes - peaks <img src="geq.gif"> 0<br>
passes - pales + pits <img src="geq.gif"> 1<br>
pales - passes + peaks <img src="geq.gif"> 1
</ul>
<p>
<li>The total number of critical points of a given type, i, belonging to an
asymmetric unit (fundamental domain) of a crystallographic unit cell
will be the rational number f(i) = (sum of Wyckoff site multiplicities
for all sites occupied by critical points of type i) / (Wyckoff site
multiplicity for the general position site). For simple high
symmetry structures, f(i) is often less than 1.

<li>We defile a "basic unit" to be an integral number of adjacent
asymmetric units which makes all 4 f(i)'s the smallest possible
integers.

<li>To satisfy the first two Morse inequalities above, the Morse 
inequalities are applied to the basic unit or the unit
cell rather than the asymmetric unit so that we are always
working with integers rather than rational numbers.

<li>The crystallographic case closest to the general
Morse inequality limits is the diamond structure in
space group #227 with basic unit
critical point counts of (1,2,2,1) and unit cell counts (8,16,16,8).

<li>The minimum number of critical points possible in a crystallographic
unit cell is 8, (i.e., 1,3,3,1) with critical points on the 8 inversion
centers of P<img src="1bar.gif"> ("triclinic simple-cubic" packing).
This count is identical to that for the four topology Betti numbers of
a 3-torus.  Betti numbers are topological invariants used in the
derivation of the Morse inequalities.
<li>The Morse inequalities listed are the original ones derived by
Marston Morse.  There is a definite need for stronger inequalities that
incorporate space group topology specific invariants.  The closest
treatment we have found is in a preprint entitled "Equivariant
Holomorphic Morse Inequalities II:  Torus and Non-Abelian Group Actions"
by Sike Wu (MSRI preprint #1996-013).

</ul>
<p>
<b>Local vs. Global Topology</b>
<p>
At this point we note a limitation in the critical net illustrations
shown in Figs. 3.1-3.7 in that they provide only local topology
information.  There is often inadequate topological information
available in drawings of critical points around pits (i.e.,
chemical cages) to fully characterize the structure.  For example, a
hexagonal close-packed (hcp) critical net illustration looks identical
to the fcc illustration in Fig. 3.5 since the numbers of critical
points in the two basic units (defined above) are the same [i.e.,
(1,6,8,3)]. However, the unit cell counts are (4,24,32,12) for fcc and
(2,12,16,6) for hcp, suggesting the presence of a superstructure in fcc.

<p>
The two structures have identical local topology since each is made up
of layers of atoms packed hexagonally with layers interleaved to produce
the densest possible packing.  However, fcc has an ABCABC...  layer
sequence in space group Fm<img src="3bar.gif">m 
while hcp has ABAB...  which requires
space group P6<sub>3</sub>/mmc.  Our
critical-net-on-orbifold convention defined in Sect. 4 incorporates
critical net, singular set, and lattice complex information to provide a full
global topology characterization, thus resolving 
ambiguities such as the fcc versus hcp case. <p>
