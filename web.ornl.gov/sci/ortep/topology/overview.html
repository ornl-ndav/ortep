<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The intended reader, or browser, is the crystallographer curious about
how geometric topology fits into crystallography.  Topologists curious
about crystallography may find the presentation naive, but different.
We are seeking crystallography and topology collaborators with
related interests to build an interactive crystallographic topology
web data base.
<p>
For our purpose we will say that crystallography is the study of atoms
in crystals, topology is the study of distortion-invariant connectivity
properties of mathematical objects, and crystallographic topology is an
intersection of those two disciplines.  Since both topology and
crystallography have many subdisciplines, there are a number of quite
different intersection regions that can be called crystallographic
topology; but we will confine this discussion to one small, well
delineated subarea.
<p>
The structural crystallography of interest involves the group theory
required to describe symmetric arrangements of atoms in crystals, and
a classification of the simplest arrangements as lattice complexes.  The
geometric topology of interest is the topological properties of
crystallographic groups, represented as orbifolds, and the Morse theory
global analysis of critical points in symmetric functions.  Here we are
taking the liberty of calling global analysis part of topology.
<p>
Our basic approach is that of a geometric crystallographer who finds the
pictorial reasoning tricks of geometric topology reasoning
intriguing.  Other crystallographers prefer equations and would probably
use algebraic topology concepts such as homology, which we seldom mention
past this point.  Being physical scientists rather than mathematicians,
we emphasize only what we feel aids physical insight or provides
computational automation possibilities while avoiding the use of
theorems and mathematical proofs.
<p>
In the working crystallography laboratory, the universal fundamental
reference is the series called the International Tables for
Crystallography (ITCr).  This series was started in 1935 and is periodically
updated and expanded.  The current edition
is sponsored by the Commission on International Tables of the
International Union of Crystallography.  Volume A, Space-Group Symmetry
(Hahn, 1995), is the chief source for the crystallographic material in
the following discussion.
<p>
It is our hope that the discipline of "Crystallographic Topology" will
eventually mature in completeness and usefulness to justify the addition
as a separate volume on this subject in the ITCr series.  To help this
happen, <b>we welcome the collaboration of crystallographers and
topologists</b> to expand the following exploratory Crystallographic
Topology 101 treatment and the incomplete Crystallographic Orbifold
Atlas appendix into an unofficial but comprehensive treatment of the
subject to be maintained on the World Wide Web as an interactive
reference source freely available to everyone.  An
<a href="http://www.unipissing.ca:80/topology/t/o/p/c/01.htm">editorial</a>
on electronic publishing from the viewpoint of a topologist
provides some interesting thoughts on the subject.

<p>
<b>Organization of Topology 101 Material</b>
<p>
There are a number of crystallographic and topological concepts 
that lead to the following mappings of
structural crystallography onto geometric topology. Only the first
two of the three lines are discussed here.
<p>
<li>Crystallographic Groups --> Elliptic and Euclidean Orbifolds<br>
<li>Crystal Structures --> Morse Functions --> Critical Nets -->
Critical Nets on Orbifolds<br>
<li>Crystal Chemistry --> Convolutions of
Lattice Complexes on Critical Nets on Orbifolds
<p>
The current Sect.  1 provides an overview and illustrates a simple
critical net, orbifold, and critical net on orbifold based on the sodium
chloride (rock salt) crystal structure.  Following a review of relevant
orbifold references, Sect.  2.1 continues to illustrate and classify the
32 elliptic 2-orbifolds derived from the crystallographic point groups
and shows how elliptic 2-orbifolds can be used as construction elements
to build the singular sets of Euclidean 3-orbifolds.  Sect.  2.2
illustrates basic topology surfaces, derivation of all 17 Euclidean
2-orbifolds from crystallographic drawings of the plane groups, and
example derivations of Euclidean 3-orbifolds by lifting Euclidean base
2-orbifolds.  Sect. 3 describes the Morse functions used
and shows additional critical net examples, using
stereoscopic illustrations, and summarizes their characteristics.  Sect.
4 illustrates the derivation of critical nets on orbifolds, their
presentation in linearized form,
and the derivation of
a symmetry-breaking family of cubic lattice complexes on orbifolds.
The crystallographic lattice complex
model as modified for critical nets on orbifolds is discussed in Sect.
5, and additional sets of cubic space group orbifolds are illustrated.
The overall structure of the cubic space group families is summarized
in Sect. 6.

<p>

Appendix A discusses the
color crystallographic groups, which have both symmetry and antisymmetry
elements.  A color-blind reading of a bicolor group (Shubnikov group)
produces a crystallographic group, and the black symmetry elements alone
produce
a normal subgroup.  The 65 color elliptic 2-orbifolds derived from the
relevant color point groups are listed and classified as a pairwise
extension of the classification used for the regular elliptic
2-orbifolds in Sect. 2.1.
Point group/subgroup relationships are then depicted
in graphical form.
Using
Wyckoff sites for 3-D bicolor space groups tabulated by Koptsik, an
example in Appendix A illustrates an alternate approach, one more suitable
for computer automation, for the derivation of Euclidean 3-orbifold
symmetry breaking families.
The graphic color elliptic 2-orbifold symbols shown in
Appendix B may be used in the construction of orbifold covers.

<p>
The Crystallographic Orbifold Atlas (in preparation)
will eventually provide a full tabulation of those topological properties
of crystallographic orbifolds that seem potentially useful to
crystallographers.  We have basic results covering most of the space
groups but have not found an optimal format for their presentation.  At
present, only the "A" family of
cubic space groups and one hexagonal space group
are discussed in the Crystallographic Topology 101 tutorial.

<p>
<b>Why Critical Nets?</b>
<p>
We sincerely believe that
critical-net and critical-net-on-orbifold crystallographic illustrations
will some day be of fundamental importance in crystal
chemistry and crystallographic topology.  Critical nets are based on the
concepts of Morse functions, Morse theory (i.e., critical point
analysis), and hyperplane arrangements in topological complexes, which
are classic topics in the mathematical topology and global analysis
literature.  <a href="orbimorse.html">Morse functions on orbifolds</a>
constitute a relatively new aspect of equivariant (i.e., group orbit
compatible) topology.

<p>
<b>Critical Points</b>
<p>
Our <a href="../ortep.html">ORTEP-III computer program</a>
can produce "critical net" illustrations that depict some canonical
topological characteristics of the ensemble of overlapping
atomic-thermal-motion Gaussian density functions in a crystal.  Only
non-degenerate critical points are considered here since a degenerate
critical point can always be distorted into a set of non-degenerate
ones through a process known as "morsification" (Dimca, 1992).  
In addition, we have
so far not found a true degenerate critical
point in a valid crystal structure and have a working hypothesis
that all crystal
structures are Morse (Marston Morse) functions (i.e., they have no
degenerate critical points).  Critical points occur where the first
derivative of the global density is zero.  The second derivative at
that point is a 3 <img src="cross.gif"> 3 symmetric matrix, which has a
non-zero determinant only if the critical point is non-degenerate . The
signs of the three eigenvalues of the second derivative matrix specify
the types of critical points, which we term peak (-,-,-), pass (+,-,-),
pale (+,+,-) and pit (+,+,+).  A degenerate critical point will have a
singular second derivative matrix with one or more zero or nearly
zero eigenvalues.
<p>
The critical points are best described as representing 0-, 1-, 2-, and
3-dimensional cells in a topological Morse function CW complex (i.e.,
C for closure finite, W for weak topology).  We use a "critical net"
representation that has unique topological "separatrices" paths joining
the critical point nodes into a graph.  We will sometimes denote the
peak, pass, pale, and pit critical points with the numbers 0, 1, 2, and
3, respectively.  The most gradual down-density paths from a peak to a
pit follow the sequence peak -> pass -> pale -> pit.  These paths,
shown by the separatrices (i.e., "connection bonds") in Figs. 1.1 and
1.2, are topologically unique. This uniqueness arises because: (a) the 
pass and pale critical points each have one unique eigenvector
connecting to the separatrices going to one peak and one pit, 
respectively, and (b) there are two-dimensional hyperplanes connecting
to the two remaining eigenvectors of each pass and pale and these 
non-parallel hyperplanes intersect each other locally to form the
pass-pale separatrices.  Additional examples are given in Sect. 3.
<p>
We postulate that there are no bifurcated (forked) separatrices or
degenerate critical points in the crystallographic critical nets of
interest here.  In experimentally derived crystallographic
macromolecule electron-density functions, this will not be the case
because of critical point merging caused by inadequate resolution
experimental data.  Theoretical quantum chemistry results may also lead
to exceptions because of added "quantum quirk" topological features.
<p>
<b>Critical Net for NaCl</b>
<p>
Fig. 1.1 is an ORTEP-III critical net illustration for one octant
of the NaCl unit cell contents with the larger corner spheres
representing Cl peaks; the smaller corner spheres, Na peaks; the
cigar-shaped ellipsoids, passes; the pancake-shaped ellipsoids, pales;
and the smallest sphere in the center, a pit.  The reason for this
choice of shapes for the pass and pale saddle points is that the passes
and pales represent edges and faces, respectively, for convex polyhedra
in special cases such as NaCl.  Non-polyhedral counterexamples are
discussed in Sect. 3.
<p>

<p>
Fig. 1.2 shows the critical point (0=peak, 1=pass, etc.)  locations
in one octant of the unit cell for NaCl.  A
sodium ion is on the peak site in the lower right front,
and a chloride ion is on the peak site in the lower right
rear.  The vectors in Fig. 1.2 point downhill, in a density sense,
along the topologically unique paths of the critical net.
<p>
NaCl crystals have the internal symmetry of space group 
Fm<img src="3bar.gif">m, which is
No. 225 in the International Tables for Crystallography (Hahn, 1995).
There is a lot of symmetry in this group; thus the general position
multiplicity within the cell is 192, which is the largest multiplicity
possible in the space groups.  Points on symmetry elements have
smaller total unit cell occupancy, called the Wyckoff site
multiplicity.  Thus there are only 4 Na + 4 Cl peaks, 24 passes, 24
pales, and 8 pits in the unit cell.  The shaded tetrahedron in Fig.
1.2 is an asymmetric unit (fundamental domain) of the unit cell,
which occupies 1/24 of the volume shown and 1/192 of the unit cell
volume.

<b>Orbifolds</b>
<p>
As Walt Kelly's philosophical comic-strip character Pogo might have said, "The
trouble with symmetry is that it's repetitious".  Orbifolds remove all
repetition; thus all space-group orbifolds will have
roughly the same size and complexity, a situation that contrasts
sharply with traditional crystallographic geometric drawings of space
group symmetry as given in the International Tables for Crystallography
(Hahn, 1995).
<p>
A crystallographic orbifold, Q, may be formally defined as the quotient
space of a sphere, S, or Euclidean, E, space modulo a discrete
crystallographic symmetry group, G (i.e., Q=K/G where K=S or E).  G is
one of the ordinary 32 2-D point groups if K is a 2-sphere, one of the 17
2-D plane groups if K is 2-Euclidean, or one of the 230 3-D space groups
if K is 3-Euclidean.  The term elliptic is used rather than spherical
because the projective plane is involved (Thurston, 1990) (see 
Sects. 2.1 and 2.2).   In the present discussion, we have no need
to generalize into dimensions higher than three or to utilize hyperbolic
orbifolds.
<p>
Another viewpoint is that an orbifold is a compact closed quotient
space that results when
all equivalent points are overlaid onto one parent
point.  In contrast to the orbifold's closed space, the crystal space
is an open (infinite) Euclidean 3-space.
For the space groups, a reasonable working definition is that a
properly bounded fundamental domain within a space group's unit cell is
an orbifold.  For the special case of a fundamental domain bounded
by mirrors, the fundamental domain is itself an orbifold.

<b>Orbifold for Space Group Fm<img src="3barbold.gif">m</b>

Fig. 1.3-left shows the 3- and 4-fold rotational symmetry axes
within an octant of the unit cell for Fm<img src="3bar.gif">m,
and Fig. 1.3-right
shows the orbifold and its singular set using the orbifold nomenclature
discussed in detail in Sect. 2.  Briefly, the
corner Wyckoff site (a), which has orbifold notation, 4'3'2', lies on
4-, 3-, and 2-fold axes running along its adjacent edges.  All four
faces contain mirrors, as denoted by the primes on the numbers
and double lines in the drawing.

The topological information for the tetrahedral Euclidean 3-orbifold of
NaCl is expressed more economically in the skeletal
drawing shown in Fig. 1.4-left, in which the viewer is positioned directly
above an apex of the tetrahedron.
The mirror locations are indicated by
the symbol 1' with the mirror for the bottom hidden face indicated by the
cornered 1' over the tetrahedron.  Every axis marked with a prime,
such as 4', has to have two adjacent mirror planes and every corner
point, such as 2'2'2' (inferred from the axes' intersections),
has to have three adjacent mirror planes.  Thus,
we can interpret the skeletal tetrahedron details almost as easily as
the double line mirror symbol drawing in Fig. 1.3.

<p>
<b>The Rubber Sheet World of Topology</b>
<p>

An artist can exercise artistic liberties to emphasize desired features
in a picture, but a topologist can and does exercise even more
topologic liberties in his rubber sheet world where any deformation is
perfectly acceptable as long as you do not tear anything (Barr, 1964).  When
topologists read the old warning label on computer punched cards, "do not
fold, mutilate, or spindle", they probably only took the third item
seriously. (Webster dictionary definition of spindle - to impale, thrust
or perforate on the spike of a spindle file).  
Some of the topologists' favorite distortions of a rectangle are shown
in <a href="orbfld2.html#fig25">Fig. 2.5</a>.
In that spirit, it is perfectly acceptable to deform
the tetrahedron into a sphere, as shown in the middle drawing, and put
the  3'3'2' dihedral corner and its attached 3' and 2' axes in the
upper hemisphere.  This makes the underlying topological space, a
silvered 3-ball, more readily apparent.

<p>

The Wyckoff site list for Fm<img src="3bar.gif">m
in the ITCr tells us there are two
mirrors, three 2' axes, one 3' axis, and one 4' axis. Yet in Fig. 1.4-middle,
it appears these numbers should be
4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively. So what is going on?
The answer is that a 3-fold axis can do strange and wondrous things
simply because it is an odd-order axis, the only one in
crystallography.  
<p>
For example, in Fig. 1.3-left a single straight
body-diagonal axis from a to b through the mirrored intersection of axes
c has two nonequivalent parts, ac and bc, while all even-ordered axes
repeat themselves about an intersection of axes.
Thus, what at first appears
to be two different axes along the top edges of the asymmetric
unit is in fact a single bent axis.  A 3-axis can also wrap a 
mirror around itself without breaking it.
Thus in Fig. 1.4-middle, the three mirror
segments in the upper hemisphere that are in contact with the 3-axis
are simply different parts of the same mirror.  All orbifold mirrors
start and stop only at even ordered axes.

<p>
<b>Linearized Critical Net on Orbifold</b>
<p>

By superimposing Fig.  1.2-right onto Fig.  1.3-right, we obtain a
critical-net-on-orbifold representation, which is one of the main
topics of our presentation.  Again taking a few topologic liberties, we
can  deform the whole critical-net-on-orbifold silvered 3-ball to
arrange the peaks, passes, pales, and pits in sequence vertically down
the page as shown in the righthand bottom drawing of Fig. 1.4.  
Thus, density decreases as you go down the page and we have
literally done the mapping E<sup>3</sup> ->
E<sup>1</sup>, which is characteristic of Morse
theory. This
linearized critical-net-on-orbifold drawing still accurately portrays
the Euclidean 3-orbifold and NaCl critical net information and is
topologically correct.  The symbols within the circles are lattice
complex symbols discussed in Sect. 5.
<p>
This critical-net-on-orbifold 
drawing with the lattice complex information for each
critical point site added provides an excellent summary of the
structure's local and global topology, particularly if the Wyckoff site
multiplicities are also recorded on the same drawing as shown in
Sect. 4.
The advantage that orbifolds and critical nets on orbifolds provide is
a concise closed-space portrait of the topology for crystallographic
groups and simple crystal structures, respectively.
<p>
<b>Question</b>
<p>
Suppose you just joined the Crystallographic Topology Orbifold Ski Club,
and they sent you the ski trail map for twin peaked Rock Salt Mountain,
which by strange coincidence looks exactly like Fig. 1.4-right.  If you
are a beginning skier and would prefer not to break your neck on your
first outing, which route should you take?  If you are an olympic class
skier, which route would you take?
If ordinary skis are 2-dimensional, what is the dimensionality of
your Rock Salt Mountain skis?
