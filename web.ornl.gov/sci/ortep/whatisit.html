The Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Plot (ORTEP) program is a computer
program, written in Fortran, for drawing crystal structure
illustrations. Ball-and-stick type illustrations of a quality suitable
for publication are produced with either spheres or thermal-motion
probability ellipsoids, derived from anisotropic temperature factor
parameters, on the atomic sites. The program also produces stereoscopic
pairs of illustrations which aid in the visualization of complex
arrangements of atoms and their correlated thermal motion patterns.

ORTEP-I was distributed in 1965 and ORTEP-II in 1976 by the senior
author, Carroll Johnson.  There were roughly 1000 citations of the
program's use for structural crytallographic publication in the 1994
CD-ROM Edition of Science Citation Index.

The 1996 version, ORTEP-III, retains the philosophy of its predecessors,
which is basically to provide a crystallographic language for writing a
"program" (the input data file) describing the crystal structure illustration.
ORTEP is noted for its versatility and high quality drawings, but it is not
particularly user-friendly to a first-time user who prefers not to read
documentation.
