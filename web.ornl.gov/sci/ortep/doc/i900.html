900 Series Instructions: Label Plotting
</H2>
</center>
<p> 
<hr>
<p> 
The 900 series allows the user to plot general titles up to 72
characters in length, chemical symbols up to 6 characters long, and
bond length labels. The bond length labels can have two decimal places
before the decimal point and one, two, or three places after the
decimal point. The 700 and 800 series instructions can plot chemical
symbols and bond length labels, but it is often desirable to position
certain labels individually with the 900 series.
<p>
ORTEP-III provides the following character set for labels:
<p>

<p>
General titles and bond length labels can be drawn either along a
general vector baseline or parallel to the plane of the drawing.
Chemical symbols are always drawn parallel to the plane. Instructions
913-916 produce general plane lettering, and instructions 901-906 produce
normal plane lettering.
<p>
Two vectors, the upright vector and the base-line vector, are needed to
describe a lettering plane. In ORTEP the upright lettering vector is
always parallel to the plane of the drawing. For perspective lettering
the base-line vector is a general vector in three dimensions.  In the
nonperspective case, the base-line vector is either along the
projection of a general vector or along the vector (in the plane of the
drawing) that is oriented with a 
<a href="i300.html#302">302 title rotation instruction</a> (theta
base line). If theta is zero, then the theta base-line vector is along
the plotter positive x axis.
<p>
The exact center of the label is always referred to when specifying the
position of the label. The program goes through the following steps to
position the center point of the label onto the drawing.
<p>
(1) A point P1 is found that is either the position of atom A (columns 10-18)
or the
mean of two atom positions (atom A and atom B) if an atom designator
exists in the atom B field (columns 19-27) of the instruction card.
<p>
(2) A point P2 is found by (a) translating from P1 along the base-line
vector for the distance specified by the parallel offset, then (b)
translating along the upright vector by the perpendicular offset
distance.
<p>
(3) A point P3 is found by projecting P2 onto the plane of the
drawing.
<p>
(4) If the "x edge reset" is greater than 0, then x is reset to this
value. If "x edge reset" is less than 0, x is reset to the positive x
plot boundary minus |x edge reset|. No resetting is done if x edge
reset equals 0. The y parameter is handled in the same manner with "y
edge reset".
<p>
Instruction 901 produces a normal plane atom label with theta base
line, using the atom label for atom A.
<p>
A normal plane title with theta base line is drawn with the 902
instruction. The title must be provided with the instruction on a
Format No. 3 trailer card. The title should be centered about columns
36-37 of that card. However, if the title begins in column 1, it will be
centered within the field automatically. (New feature in ORTEP-III)
<p>
A general vector title with normal plane lettering is produced by the
903 instruction and with general plane lettering by 913. The general
vector is from atom A to atom B. The title must be provided with the
instruction on a Format No. 3 trailer card. The title should be
centered about columns 36-37 of that card. If the title begins in
column 1, it will be centered automatically.
<p>
Instructions 904, 905, 906, 914, 915, and 916 produce general-vector
bond-length labels. The first three are for normal plane lettering with
one, two, and three places after the decimal point, respectively; and
the last three are for the corresponding bond-length labels with
general plane lettering. The general vector is from atom A to atom B.
Note that the sense of the vector is important in order to have the
label right side up.
<p>
The format for the entire 900 series is as follows:
