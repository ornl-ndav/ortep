600 Series Instructions: Positioning and Scaling
</H2>
</center>
<p>

These instructions are used to direct the placement of the origin point
ORGN (specified by 
<a href="i500.html">instruction 501, 505, or 506</a>) onto the drawing
(dimensioned by 
<a href="i300.html#301">instruction 301</a>). In addition the three-dimensional
assembly of atoms (chosen by the 
<a href="i400.html">400 series instructions</a>) constituting
the model is scaled. The atomic centers of the model will then be
hanging in space above and below the drawing board, correctly
positioned to be projected from the eye point described with
instruction 301.

<p>
Several normal modes of operation are available to the user for
positioning and scaling the model. Instruction 601 requires the user to
supply a complete explicit description of position (X0,Y0) and scale
(SCAL1). At the other extreme, instruction 604 automatically scales and
positions the model so that the peripheral projected atom centers will
touch two opposite borders and the peripheral atoms in the remaining
dimensions will be centered on the drawing. An intermediate mode is
available through 602, which provides automatic scaling after explicit
positioning. This usually allows only one edge of the model to touch a
border. Finally, instruction 603 requires an explicit scale and does
automatic centering.
<p>
In general, the 604 instruction is the easiest and safest one to use,
but situations arise in which the user should not relinquish control to
the program. For example, if a big illustration is to be drawn
piecewise on a small plotter, the user will have to maintain control
over the scale, and probably over positioning, so that the partial
plots can be fitted together correctly.
<p>
A second scale factor SCAL2 is required in connection with the
ellipsoid (or sphere) size. It is a dimensionless scale factor ratio
used to modify all rms displacement values before plotting
equiprobability ellipsoids or spheres. SCAL2 values for given
probabilities are tabulated in various books on statistics such as
D. B. Owen's <i>Handbook of Statistical Tables</i>.
The <a href="defs.html#pp">primer constant</a> for SCAL2 is
1.54, which corresponds to 50% probability.  
<p>ORTEP-III saves the
user the time of looking up the SCAL2 value
corresponding to a desired probability.
If the value entered in
columns 37-45 is a negative whole number in the range -1 to -99, it is
interpreted as the probability of the ellipsoids or spheres, and the value of
SCAL2 is set by the program by table lookup.
<p>
If the instruction's entry for X0, Y0, SCAL1, or SCAL2 is "0" or blank,
the primer constant value is used. This means that an X0 or Y0 cannot
be entered as exactly zero. If zero is wanted, a small nonzero number
should be entered.

Additional flexibility is provided through the incremental instructions
611, 612, and 613. These allow the user to "nudge" the model or modify
the scale factor (SCAL1), or both, after the parameters have been
initially set with a previous 600 series instruction. The 611
instruction adds <img src="delta.uc.gif">X0, <img
src="delta.uc.gif">Y0 to the previous X0, Y0 position for the
ORGN and multiplies the existing SCAL1 by <img
src="delta.uc.gif">K (except if <img src="delta.uc.gif">K =
0, SCAL1 is unmodified). Instruction 612 increments the position and
then does an automatic scaling; 613 first increments the scale (by
multiplying by <img src="delta.uc.gif">K) and then automatically
repositions.

<p>

A conservative general approach is to follow a 604 with a 611 having
<img src="delta.uc.gif">X0 = 0, <img src="delta.uc.gif">Y0
= 0 and <img src="delta.uc.gif">K = 0.9. This will simply reduce
the scale 10% about the origin so that there is more space for labels,
etc.
