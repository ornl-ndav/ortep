200 Series Instructions: Plotter Control
</H2>
</center>
<p> 
<hr>
<p> 

The 200 series is a group of instructions that control the device, real
or virtual, that receives the information to output the ORTEP
illustration. This may be, for example, an actual hardware plotter, a
computer monitor, or a file of page description language instructions
that will produce a hard copy of the illustration when the file is
downloaded to a laser printer. Because no single word can describe all
of the possibilities, the word "plotter" will be used.

<p>

The 200 instructions control plotter initialization, frame advance,
color control, termination, and any other peripheral commands that are
required for a particular equipment configuration or plotting package.
When the program is modified for a different equipment configuration,
the series 200 instructions, which are executed through subroutine
F200, should be redefined to suit the user's requirements.

<p>

The 201 instruction initializes plotting and must be executed before
any plotting can take place. It is a safe policy always to make this
the first instruction card. If the 201 and 301 instructions are
omitted, all calculations are carried out but no plotting is done.

<p>

The 202 instruction with no parameters is used to terminate plotting.
With parameters, the 202 instruction may be used to shift the plot
origin (frame advance).

<p>

The 201/202 (with no parameters) form an initialize/terminate pair and
must always appear in pairs in the ORTEP input file. The pair may occur
more than once (unlike OR TEP-II). Each call to 201 begins a new plot
page.

<p>

Instruction 204 is used to change the color of (or plotter pen used
for) subsequent plotting. The default value is 0 for black
(or pen #1).  The screen and Postscript drivers built into ORTEP-III
define color value 2 as red,
3 as green, 4 as blue, 5 as cyan, 6 as magenta, and 7 as yellow.
(The value of 1 is not defined in the Postscript driver.)
<p>
Instruction 205 is used to vary the thickness of the
plotted lines. The unit for width is thousandths of an inch, and the
default value is 5. For both the 204 and 205 instructions, if columns 10-18
contain "0" or are blank, the default settings are restored.
