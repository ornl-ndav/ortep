1100 Series Instructions: Save Sequence
</H2>
</center>
<p> 
<hr>
<p> 
It is often desirable to repeat a sequence of instructions one or more
times with other instructions executed between the repetitions. The
1100 series allows the user to do this without the necessity of putting
in duplicate sequences of instruction cards. It is not an elaborate
looping device, but it does give additional flexibility to the system.
<p>
The three instructions in this series are 1101 to start the save
sequence, 1102 to terminate the save sequence, and 1103 to execute the
save sequence. All instruction cards and their trailer cards between
the 1101 and 1102 instructions are executed and saved. Each subsequent
1103 instruction then repeats all the saved instructions. There are no
parameters to be entered with the 1100 series instructions.
