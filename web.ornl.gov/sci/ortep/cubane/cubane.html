Cubane - A Detailed Example
</H2>

<p> 
<hr>
<p>
The standard example for illustrating the use of ORTEP is the novel compound cubane
(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>),
whose carbon-carbon bonds lie along the edges of a cube within experimental error.
The structure was published in 1964 by E. B. Fleischer (Journal of the American
Chemical Society, Vol. 86, p.3889).
The compound crystallizes with the trigonal symmetry of space group 
R<img src="3bar.gif">. The <img src="3bar.gif"> axis lies
along a body diagonal of the molecule, and as a result the compound contains only four
unique atoms. These are one carbon and its attached hydrogen in 
general positions off 
the <img src="3bar.gif">
axis (C1 and H1) and one carbon and its hydrogen in special positions on 
the <img src="3bar.gif"> axis (C2 and
H2). Anisotropic temperature factor coefficients were fitted to the carbon atoms during the
least-squares refinement of the structure, and isotropic temperature factors were used for the
hydrogen atoms. The anisotropic temperature factors given for the carbon atoms are of the
type called 0 in ORTEP.

<hr>
The 100 instructions are neither associated with nor required for producing an illustration.
They are shown here to demonstrate how they are used. 
<p>
A <a href="../doc/i100.html#101">101 instruction</a>
is used to obtain a
tabulation of the atoms surrounding one atom or a series of several designated atoms. For
example, to obtain a list of all atoms (hydrogen and carbon atoms) out to a distance of 3.61
&Aring; about the two carbons C1 and C2, the following 101 instruction would be used.
<pre>
      101   155501        2        1        4     3.61
           |_______________|      |__________|   |____|
                  (a)                  (b)         (c)
</pre>
where the parts designate:
<p>
<ul>
(a) origin atoms 1 through 2 of symmetry operation 1
<p>
(b) target atoms 1 through 4 of all symmetry and translation operations
<p>
(c) a distance D<sub>max</sub> of 3.61 &Aring;
</ul>
<p>
A <a href="../doc/i100.html#101">102 instruction</a>
gives both interatomic distances and interatomic angles. The
following instruction could be used to find all covalent bonds and bond angles about the two
carbons.
<pre>
      102   155501        2        1        4      1.8
</pre>
In this case a smaller D<sub>max</sub>
was used so that only the distances and 
angles of immediate interest would be computed since there are n(n - 1)/2 
angles for n interatomic vectors about an atom.
<hr>
Plotting is initialized with a <a href="../doc/i200.html">201 instruction</a>.
<pre>
      201
</pre>
<hr>
The two plot boundary dimensions can be equal for the present illustration since the
cubane molecule is a cube. A 5 
<img src="cross.gif"> 5 inch boundary is specified with a 0.5 inch margin to
give a 4 
<img src="cross.gif"> 4 inch square working area. A 
15 inch view distance might be reasonable to use
in viewing a model of this size.  These are set with the 
<a href="../doc/i300.html#301">301 instruction</a>.

      301      5.0      5.0      15.      0.5
</pre>
<hr>
The subject of the illustration is a single complete cubane molecule. Since all the
atoms of the molecule were not provided in the input atoms list, the "missing" atoms may be
found by using the <a href="../doc/i400.html#402">402 instruction</a>
to specify a 
<a href="../doc/defs.html#soe">sphere of enclosure</a>,
centered on the dummy atom 5, 
which is at the
center of a cubane molecule. A radius of 3.2 &Aring; should be adequate to find all the atoms and
isolate a single molecule.

                  (a)                  (b)         (c)
</pre>
where the parts designate:
<p>
<ul>
(a) a run of origin atom(s) representing sphere centers 
from atom 5 to atom 5 in symmetry
position 55501 (in this example, a single sphere) 
<p>
(b) a run of target atoms from atom 1 to atom 4
<p>
(c) a sphere radius of 3.2 &Aring;
</ul>
<hr>
The <a href="../doc/i500.html#501">501 instruction</a>
is used to establish a coordinate system in order to orient the molecule.
In this case, the coordinate system is defined along the edges of the cubane cube.
The origin will be positioned on the dummy atom 5. The
desired coordinate system orientation will be defined by specifying two vectors from the
special position atom 255501 to the two symmetry-related general-position atoms 155501
and 155502.
<pre>
      501   555501   255501   155501   255501   155502        0        0
</pre>
<hr>
The <a href="../doc/i500.html#502">502 instruction</a>
is used to rotate the molecule relative to the
established coordinate system to optimize the appearance of
the illustration.  A rotation of
25<sup>o</sup> about the y axis (axis 2)
followed by a rotation of 28<sup>o</sup>
about the x axis (axis 1) will produce a satisfactory view of the
molecule.
<pre>
      502        2      25.        1      28.
</pre>
<hr>
To position and scale the subject for projection onto the 
"drawing board" and to utilize
all available space, a <a href="../doc/i600.html#600">604 instruction</a>
is used, which will automatically set X0, Y0, and SCALl.
However, the ellipsoid scale factor ratio SCAL2 must be specified independently.
A value of -50 will provide thermal ellipsoids 
corresponding to 50% probability as ORTEP sets the value of
SCAL2 to 1.54. (If the value supplied is positive, ORTEP interprets the
value as SCAL2.  If the value is negative, ORTEP interprets
the value
as a probability and sets the appropriate value of SCAL2 automatically.)
<pre>
      604                                 -50
</pre>
<hr>
The stereoscopic rotation for the left eye can be done at this point with the 
<a href="../doc/i500.html#503">503
instruction</a>. A rotation of 2.7<sup>o</sup>
about the y axis (axis 2) is used for the left-eye view. Later in the program, a 
-2.7<sup>o</sup> rotation
about the same axis will be made for the right-eye view to give a total interocular angle of
5.4<sup>o</sup>. 
<pre>
      503        2      2.7
</pre>
<hr>
Since the structure will be drawn twice, once for each eye, the 
<a href="../doc/i1100.html">save sequence</a>
feature can be used to shorten the program. Note that the instructions between the start
(1101) and end (1102) instructions are both executed and saved the first time through. They
can then be re-executed as many times as desired by using the "execute save sequence"
instruction 1103.
<p>
The 1101 instruction starts the save sequence.
<pre>
     1101
</pre>
<hr>
The <a href="../doc/i1000.html#1001">1001 instruction</a> (or 511)
stores the information needed for the overlap hidden-line
correction (i.e., as a projected boundary ellipse for each atom and a quadrangle
approximation for each bond). The bonds are specified with a Format No. 2 trailer card
identical to that used in the 812 instruction described below.
<pre>

The ATOMS array currently contains all the atom designators for one cubane
molecule. The molecule is drawn in two separate steps so that the hydrogen and carbon atoms
can be given different graphical representations. To draw the carbon atoms 
(<a href="../doc/defs.html#anr">ANR</a> = 1,2), a
standard model produced with the new 
<a href="../doc/i700.html">706/716 instruction</a> is used. 
[This model is the same as that produced with a
705/715 instruction that (a) draws the three principal-plane forward traces and the 
boundary-plane trace (NPLANE = 4), (b) omits the reverse sides of the principal planes (NDOT = 0),
(c) draws the forward principal axes without additional shading (NLINE = 1), and (d) omits
the reverse principal axes (NDASH = 0).] In addition, chemical symbols are drawn with letters
0.12 in. high (before projection) and displaced from the atomic center by 0.3 in. horizontally and 
0.4 in. vertically.
<pre>

                                   1        2
</pre>
The 716 instruction is used, rather than 706, to shorten the output listing of the
example. A 706 instruction would provide a listing of all coordinates.
<p>
The hydrogen atoms (ANR = 3, 4) are to be drawn with a different standard 
model (<a href="../doc/i700.html">instruction 702/712</a>)
than the carbon atoms. Chemical symbols are 0.12 in. high and offset 0.25 in. horizontally
and vertically.

<hr>
The most convenient procedure for drawing bonds is to use the implicit bond 
<a href="../doc/i800.html#802">instruction 812</a>.
All other information can be entered with a single Format No. 2 trailer
card.

<a href="../doc/defs.html#anr">atom number run</a> of atoms 
making up one member of bond atom pairs to be drawn
<p>
(b) target atom number run of atoms making up second member of bond atom pairs
<p>
(c) bond type 4
<p>
(d) the distance range 0.9 to 1.6 &Aring; that will cover all covalent bond
distances
<p>
(e) the bond radius is 0.04 &Aring;
</ul>
<p>
The remaining fields on the card can be blank, since a complete set of bond distance
labels is not desired.
<hr>
The last feature of the illustration is the labeling 
with <a href="../doc/i900.html">900 instructions</a>. Because of the
symmetry, there are only two different C-C bond lengths in cubane. These are C1-C1 and
C1-C2. One example of each of these bonds will be labeled. For variety, one will be labeled
with a normal bond-length label and the other with a perspective label. The two bonds that
can be labeled most advantageously are 155504-155503 and 255504-155505. The labels
will be 0.12 in. high and displaced vertically from the bond center by -0.4 in.
<pre>

</pre>
	Finally, a caption for the illustration is drawn. This can conveniently be positioned by
"hanging" it from the dummy atom 555501 and "bouncing" it 3 in. from the left x
boundary and 0.5 in. from the lower y boundary. The caption is 0.2 in. high.
