	A procedure is under development to derive families of topologically
transmuted crystal structures using the methods of 3-manifold topology [1]. 
<p>	For a known starting crystal structure, Radon Nikodym derivatives [2] for
pairs of thermal ellipsoids are used in a maximum likelihood calculation to
find peak, pass, pale, and pit critical points and their topological connecting
paths. This provides a 3-D critical net representation [2] of the Morse
function global thermal motion density. We then add representations for the
rotational axes and mirrors of the space group, and calculate all intersections
(within an asymmetric unit of the unit cell) with the Morse function Heegaard
surface, which is a constant density surface partitioning (passes + peaks) and
(pales + pits) into two disjoint sets [3]. <p>
	The asymmetric unit is topologically cut out and wrapped up to superimpose
all symmetry equivalent faces of the asymmetric unit, thus producing a
"Heegaard critical net on orbifold" closed space representation of the crystal
structure, space group, and Heegaard surface. The Heegaard surface is used in
Heegaard splitting [1,3] of the space group Euclidean 3 orbifold [2] and
critical net into a pair of handlebody 3-orbifolds [4] with a shared hyperbolic
2-orbifold boundary between them. The peaks and passes of the critical net are
in the (+) handlebody and the remainder in the (-). 
<p>
	To derive other crystal structures, one can transmute the above Heegaard
surface and critical net to other forms using some of the many innovative
approaches to 3-manifold classification. A simple example is to interchange
Haken quadrilateral normal surfaces [1,3] in the F-43m tetrahedral 3-orbifold
[2,4], thus transmuting the ZnS and NaCl structure types.
