Crystallographic Morse Functions on Orbifolds

<P>
Morse functions and orbifolds are separate concepts used in global analysis
and geometric topology, respectively.  We find that a combination of the
two is useful for classification purposes in the unofficial
crystallographic orbifold atlas we are compiling.


<P>
Using peak-pass-pale-pit terminology for the four types of non-degenerate
critical points (zero gradient points) in 3-Euclidean space, a
"Crystallographic Morse Function" (CMF) is an infinite pattern of 3-D
isotropic normal probability density functions (pdf) centered on special
space group orbit (Wyckoff) positions.  The peak positions are at the pdf
centers and the overlapping pdf tails determine the pass, pale, pit, and
gradient-flow separatrices arrangement.  The arrangement is then
"orbi-folded" to form a 3-Euclidean orbifold with Morse function
superimposed.


<P>
The model utilizes and extends the crystallographic lattice-complex concept
(defined in Chapter 14 of the "International Tables for Crystallography,
Vol. A (1995)" as "the set of all point configurations that may be
generated within one type of Wyckoff set (orbit)").  For example, the basic
CMF orbifold in space group <I>Im</I>3<I>m</I> is the body centered cubic arrangement
that contains eight lattice complexes, <I>i.e.</I>, four 0-D critical points,
three 1-D topologically unique gradient-flow separatrices joining
consecutive critical points, and one shortest path between the peak and
pit.  Each of these elements is contained within a single 2-elliptic
orbifold domain within the 3-Euclidean orbifold.  A node-link directed
graph, representing this configuration and the associated Wyckoff
multiplicities, characterizes both the CMF and the space-group orbifold. 
The Morse function provides a unique format for drawing and comparing
orbifold graphs because of the Morse mapping onto a 1-D Euclidean space.  A
"duplex" matroid representation also exists with the elliptic 2-orbifold
singular-set arrangement in one direction and Morse CW-complex poset
arrangement in the other.


<P>
We conjecture that in conjunction with our previously described "color
orbifold covers" specification of group / normal subgroup pairs of
orbifolds based on color groups, the crystallographic 3-Euclidean orbifolds
should be classified and documented using the embedding characteristics for
some basis set of CMFs.  For crystal chemistry research, this would
provide a very useful and geometrically intuitive classification.  We are
currently working with the cubic orbifolds.


<P>
Critiques on this approach and pointers to related literature and research combining orbifolds and Morse theory would be appreciated.
