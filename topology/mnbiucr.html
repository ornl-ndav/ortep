The third revision of the Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Plot Program,
ORTEP-III, is now available. The program, including source code,
precompiled versions for DOS and Macintosh personal computers, the
complete user manual as a downloadable Postscript file, online
documentation, examples, and helper programs, is available on the World
Wide Web at http://www.ornl.gov/ortep/ortep.html. The program may also
be obtained via anonymous ftp from ftp.ornl.gov in the directory
/pub/ortep. All inquiries, comments, questions, problems, suggestions,
etc. should be sent to ortep@ornl.gov.
<p>
This update to ORTEP was undertaken to incorporate some of the advances
in computing and printing technologies made since the previous release.
Built into the code are drivers to produce Postscript and HPGL/2 files
of the ORTEP illustrations. These files may be printed on a variety of
printers and plotters and may be imported into a number of other
computer applications. Also, ORTEP-III includes a screen driver built
around the free graphics library PGPLOT* that permits the user to see
the illustration on the screen before producing a hard copy.
<p>
Changes and new features in ORTEP-III include: number of input atoms
increased from 166 to 500, number of symmetry operators increased from
48 to 96, the ability to enter symmetry operators using the format
provided in the International Tables, lower case letters added for
labeling, color, atom "features" to make selection of atoms more
flexible, an interactive line editor for making changes to the input
file without leaving the program, and the ability to produce critical
net illustrations (as described elsewhere).
